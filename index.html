<H1 align=center>SIMPLIFYING CONCEPTS</H1>
The <b>Internet</b> is a structure made up of millios of computers whose users can communicate with each other and share information.
<BR></BR>
The <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b> gives Internet users easy access to information on the Internet.
<BR></BR>
<b>HTML</b> is Hypertext Markup Language and it is the main, or most common, type of document on the web.  There are other types such as text, images, videos, and music.  HTML was designed to describe the contents of a web page in a very general way.
<BR></BR>
<b>HTTP</b> is Hypertext Transfer Protocol that sends requests to a srver.
<BR></BR>
<b>Computers are stupid</b> because they can only do what programmers tell them to do.  The programmers have to write in a language that the computer can read.  This is referred to as <B>CODING.</B>
<H3>Let's take a look at some of the basic HTML vocabulary.</H3>
<ul></ul>
<LI><B>ELEMENT:</B>  Everything within a set of <B>opening and closing tags.</B>
<LI><B>TAG:</B>  Turns on a feature which is indicated by an <b>opening tag,</b> and turns off a feature indicated by a <B>closing tag.</B>
<LI><B>INLINE ELEMENTS:</B>  Tags that do not require a closing tag.
<LI><B>BLOCK ELEMENTS:</B>  Tags that require a closing tag.  Block Elements are similar to an invisible box being placed around the text.
<LI><B>ATTRIBUTE:</B>  A property of an HTML element.
<LI>There is a tag to do <B>BOLD</B> text.
<LI>There is a tag to do <B><EM>emphasis</B></EM> such as italics.
<LI>There are also tags to do line breaks and paragraphs.
<BR></BR>
There are many others.  There are tags to do almost everything.  After all, <B>computers are stupid</B> and will only do what we tell them to do, so we have to talk to them in a language they can understand--<B>HTML</B>
